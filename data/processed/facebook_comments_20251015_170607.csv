New to this page Iam so intrigued with our sky’s an Space  as a kid I used to lay outside at night before bedtime on top of my parents cars an just look up at all the stars ⭐️ an wonder what was going on out in our universe hoping one day   We could travel to space to another planet to live an travel back on forth to home on earth 
It used to be so peaceful an amazing to look up an see the night sky  darkness with stars shining then as time went on. The revolution of sound light from the Cities an smog took over the peaceful night sky in the city areas so now you have to go miles out of town just to look up an enjoy the vast experience of the Night Sky’s",,2025-10-08T17:49:49.000Z,0

1347647323397307,Y29tbWVudDoxMzQ3NjQ3MzIzMzk3MzA3XzExMTI4NDI1MTc3MTUwMzc=,"several years ago, I emailed an illustration of a swarm of asteroids I saw in the early evening darkened overhead sky. It was in the mid 70's over western Canada. I had no camera. I drew an image of the string of green asteroids - I called them asteroids anyway. There were several dozen large boulders leading the swarm. They got smaller at the tail end. I could visibly make out the jagged edges on the front ones. They were emitting a green light. They were slowly spinning as they traveled westward towards the setting sun. That's when they became invisible in the brighter sky. I've mentioned this to Nasa before but never got a reply. They likely think I'm insane. I created an illustration, but it won't let me post here. Perhaps someone else out there witnessed this as well to back me up. Cheers everyone!",,2025-10-09T02:28:37.000Z,0

Observations and logic indicate that the self-generator is both empirical and practical. Advanced excitation engineers can develop the self-generator as an alternative to the ITER Tokamak Fusion research.
