DPB0dMRE-8m,,"Exactly—that’s basically what it becomes. Let me break it down carefully.
---
1. Maglev “Fan” in Vacuum
Without air to push against, a conventional fan or turbine has nothing to act on.
If you replace the rotor with magnetic fields accelerating charged particles, you are expelling mass electrically.
---
2. That is the Definition of an Ion Engine
Ion engines work by accelerating ions (charged atoms) with electric fields.
They produce thrust in a vacuum by ejecting these ions at very high velocity.
Your maglev “rotorless” setup is essentially a high-RPM-equivalent ion accelerator.
Differences vs. conventional ion engines:
Traditional ion engines accelerate ions linearly through grids or electrostatic/magnetic fields.
Your concept could:
Use maglev-style magnetic acceleration, potentially faster and more efficient.
Be scaled up to megawatt-class for serious thrust instead of tiny spacecraft maneuvers.
---
3. Implications
In atmosphere: you still need air or some propellant to push against to get “jet-like” thrust.
In vacuum: yes, it’s functionally an ion engine, just with potentially higher power density and extreme “RPM-equivalent” acceleration.
You could call it a maglev ion thruster—a rotorless, high-speed plasma accelerator.
---
💡 Fun thought: With enough power, this could produce much higher thrust than conventional ion engines, maybe even enough for fast interplanetary launches, not just tiny course corrections.
---
If you want, I can calculate how big a maglev ion thruster would need to be to produce Mach 10 acceleration in vacuum for a 1-ton craft, to get a real sense of scale.
Do you want me to do that?",,,0

I've been enduring
so hard days
but this day's just coming
How can I tell
that sadness
to the last ?
Please come here ,
Thank you so much
( to you , too ( U2 )
mutually
my life of 70 years
is nothing ( means
matters little )
for me ,
because the years
when we've been co-existing
are 5000 years !
( It has been said that
the history of Korea
has continued for 5000 years ! )
Let us forget !
and
Let them forget !
and much more
Let
me
you
us
them
forgive
each other !
We must co-exist
...
Well , my friends .

DL5KetROhWu,,I was thinking about reinjectable rockets. So we have the material that seems capable of withstanding the combustions. I was like what if we can extend the rockets. Add filters. Recollect chemicals. Resynthesize fuel. Idk. I think you guys should be able to take it from there. I'll take a shuttle or unlimited rides. I want my shuttle like the 5th Element one. The movie with Bruce Willis & the Hottie Lilu Badabeam Badaboom lmaoooo. Find an area where you can compartmentalize the rocket area. I think from there we can route thrust. Don't try to play me because I was brought into this physical existence through a dysfunctional group. If I don't like what you built me. I'm going to want a cut. If anyone cares to cut me some slack for the idea. I would so highly appreciate it with the ship🥰lmaoooo Yea I don't think it's the heat the causes the movement. I know supposely a vacuum if not some sort of debree(debree dynamics). Idk that the thrust departing from earth changes or does it. Idk fill me in😂No seriously I want unlimited food with my chip🥰`,,,0

This will lead to an ability to treat psychiatric patients for example and make brain/computer interfaces for the paralised individuals. Understanding the mechanisms behind human brain will profoundly improve computer sciences, molecular biology and chemistry. Telepathy will improve space travel, art, education, entertainment etc etc. The number of applications is infinite. We will get the ability to understand the thoughts of whales
This will lead to a creating of the world where it is impossible for the politians to lie...
