The Orionid meteor shower reaches its peak on the night of Oct. 21-22, with a new moon providing ideal skywatching conditions. The Draconids will also be visible earlier in the month.

NASA's James Webb Space Telescope captured this blowtorch of seething gases erupting from a volcanically growing monster star. Stretching across eight light-years, the length of the stellar eruption is approximately twice the distance between our Sun and our next-nearest stars in the Alpha Centauri system. The size and strength of this stellar jet are rare, according to researchers.

The jets from protostars we observe are mainly from low-mass stars, but the discovery of this particular jet offers evidence that protostellar jets must scale up with the mass of the star powering them: The more massive the stellar engine propelling the plasma, the larger the gusher's size.
