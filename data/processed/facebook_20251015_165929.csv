It was in the mid 70's over western Canada. I had no camera. I drew an image of the string of green asteroids - I called them asteroids anyway. There were several dozen large boulders leading the swarm. They got smaller at the tail end. I could visibly make out the jagged edges on the front ones. They were emitting a green light. They were slowly spinning as they traveled westward towards the setting sun. That's when they became invisible in the brighter sky. I've mentioned this to Nasa before but never got a reply. They likely think I'm insane. I created an illustration, but it won't let me post here. Perhaps someone else out there witnessed this as well to back me up.
