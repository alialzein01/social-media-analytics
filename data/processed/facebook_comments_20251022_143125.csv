Developing air defense in a way that has never happened before.
It depends on the method of electromagnetic attraction and repulsion, which will perform the defense task without the need for defense in any other way or loss of equipment.
We are placing equipment equipped with an electromagnetic propulsion and attraction method, which in turn repels the air aggression in a certain way and attracts it to the target in another specific way, where no equipment will be used to defend the borders except in this way. This is a very short summary of my invention, which will change the method of air defense while completely preserving civil aviation.
I hope to find someone who knows about my invention and start working with it.",,2025-09-25T17:20:58.000Z,0
