It was in the mid 70's over western Canada. I had no camera. I drew an image of the string of green asteroids - I called them asteroids anyway. There were several dozen large boulders leading the swarm. They got smaller at the tail end. I could visibly make out the jagged edges on the front ones. They were emitting a green light. They were slowly spinning as they traveled westward towards the setting sun. That's when they became invisible in the brighter sky. I've mentioned this to Nasa before but never got a reply. They likely think I'm insane. I created an illustration, but it won't let me post here. Perhaps someone else out there witnessed this as well to back me up.

Developing air defense in a way that has never happened before.
It depends on the method of electromagnetic attraction and repulsion, which will perform the defense task without the need for defense in any other way or loss of equipment.
We are placing equipment equipped with an electromagnetic propulsion and attraction method, which in turn repels the air aggression in a certain way and attracts it to the target in another specific way, where no equipment will be used to defend the borders except in this way. This is a very short summary of my invention, which will change the method of air defense while completely preserving civil aviation.
