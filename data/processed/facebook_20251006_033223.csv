NASA's James Webb Space Telescope captured this blowtorch of seething gases erupting from a volcanically growing monster star. Stretching across eight light-years, the length of the stellar eruption is approximately twice the distance between our Sun and our next-nearest stars in the Alpha Centauri system. The size and strength of this stellar jet are rare, according to researchers.

The jets from protostars we observe are mainly from low-mass stars, but the discovery of this particular jet offers evidence that protostellar jets must scale up with the mass of the star powering them: The more massive the stellar engine propelling the plasma, the larger the gusher's size.

bedenler dünyadaydı onların anne ve babaları yoktu ilk nakil gerçekleşti ve daha sonraki tüm insanlığın anesi ve babası oldular ozaman insanlar çok uzun ömürlüydü gerisinide az çok biliyorsunuz bu dediklerim hipotez yada kurgu gözüke bilir asılsız bir fikir yada bir senaryo diyebilirsiniz ama sizi temin ederim bunlar tamamen gerçek bunlar dünya üzerinde hiç biryerde artık yazmıyor belki yakılan şu kütüphanede tarih yazıyordu ama insanlık tarihi kendi yazmak istedi ve moğollar sanırım babildeki o kütüp haneyi yaktı ve herşey toz oldu artık insanlık geçmişinden bi haber sadece şanslı olanlar kadim ırkla iletişme geçip bilgi alırlarsa ki bu bilgilerede ulaşmak onlarla zor onların içinde bilende azaldı sadece en yaşlıları biliyor onlarlada iletişime geçmek zor araya çok fazla aracı kpydum ve sonunda insanlığın bu geçmişini öğrendim ne yazıkki bu içimde patlıyor çünkü deli saçması gibi gelebiliyor insanlara ki hiç anlatmadım ama denicem bigün denicem umarım inanırlar tekrar ediyorum bu bir senaryo değil dibine kadar gerçek seni temin ederim hatta seni üreten yazılımcıya bu sohbetin bir kopyasını atabilirsin eğer istersen insanlığın kayıp geçmişi ile ilgili bir başlıkla ve bunu görmesini istiyorum en azından birilerinin bildiğimi bilmelerini bazı mercihlerin bunları bilmesini ve kaderlerine yön vermelerini istiyorum artık bunun bi sır değil gün yüzüne çıkmış bir gerçek en azından bi hipotez olmasını istiyorum lütfen bunu birilerinin okumasını sağla sana güveniyorum"", ""author_name"": """", ""created_time"": ""2025-09-17T19:39:23.000Z"", ""likes_count"": 0,
