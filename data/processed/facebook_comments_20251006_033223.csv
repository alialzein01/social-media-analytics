Developing air defense in a way that has never happened before.
It depends on the method of electromagnetic attraction and repulsion, which will perform the defense task without the need for defense in any other way or loss of equipment.
We are placing equipment equipped with an electromagnetic propulsion and attraction method, which in turn repels the air aggression in a certain way and attracts it to the target in another specific way, where no equipment will be used to defend the borders except in this way. This is a very short summary of my invention, which will change the method of air defense while completely preserving civil aviation.
I hope to find someone who knows about my invention and start working with it.",,2025-09-25T17:20:58.000Z,0

I see others comments asking what a conjunction is. A conjunction is just usually a close pairing, of bright celestial objects, that only lasts for a short time. 
I believe it describes that in the original post, but apparently many readers here have missed this information.
As an astronomy instructor and lecturer, I usually post a diagram or photograph of conjunctions that I have produced before photographically or with artwork.

These cosmic jets and other large cosmic structures may create tensile energy fields in the universe. The energy peaks at the ends of these fields may function as natural ‘jump points’ similar to quantum entanglement. Perhaps the key to fast travel in the universe is a network formed by these peaks.
